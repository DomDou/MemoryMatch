# MemoryMatch

This is a memory match game that I made during my last semester in college. It uses a framework that was made with the help of the whole class and the teacher.

This game contains 3 different difficulty levels and also keeps track of time and attempts.

*Note: Make sure to have the res folder next to the .exe when launching.*
